# Story of Data Analysis: Understanding Global Well-Being

## 1. Dataset Description
The dataset under analysis encompasses various attributes that reflect the well-being of countries across multiple years. Key columns include:
- **Country name**: Name of the country.
- **Year**: The year the data was collected.
- **Life Ladder**: A score representing individuals' perceptions of their own lives.
- **Log GDP per capita**: A logarithmic transformation of the GDP per capita, used to normalize the data.
- **Social support**: The extent to which individuals feel supported by their community.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average number of years a person is expected to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Score indicating the perceived freedom individuals have in making life choices.
- **Generosity**: Measure of how much individuals donate to others, either in time or money.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Level of perceived corruption in entities including government and business.
- **Positive affect**: Self-reported feelings of happiness and positivity.
- **Negative affect**: Self-reported feelings of sadness and negativity.
- **is_outlier**: Indicator variable identifying if a data point is classified as an outlier.

## 2. Types of Analysis Performed
The analysis conducted on the dataset included several critical steps:

- **Missing Value Handling**: Initial data exploration revealed some missing entries, particularly in the **Generosity** and **Social support** columns. Appropriate techniques, such as mean imputation and forward filling, were employed to handle these missing values, ensuring a complete dataset for further analysis.

- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix was generated to understand relationships among the variables. This analysis highlighted strong correlations between **Log GDP per capita** and **Life Ladder**, suggesting a link between economic prosperity and perceived well-being.

- **Outlier Detection using Isolation Forest**: An Isolation Forest model was implemented to detect outliers in the dataset, particularly in the **Life Ladder** and **Log GDP per capita** columns. This method effectively flagged several data points, which were then examined for validity and impact on overall trends.

- **Clustering using K-Means**: To explore the data further, a K-Means clustering algorithm was utilized, segmenting countries into distinct clusters based on their well-being scores and socio-economic indicators. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method.

## 3. Key Findings and Insights
The analysis yielded several insightful findings:

- **Relationship Between Economy and Well-Being**: The correlation analysis confirmed a robust link between GDP per capita and life satisfaction. Countries with higher economic outputs typically scored higher on the Life Ladder.

- **Outliers Indicating Unusual Cases**: The isolation forest method revealed outliers, including some wealthy countries with low life satisfaction scores. This indicated potential socio-political issues that might not align with financial prosperity.

- **Distinct Clusters of Countries**: The K-Means clustering identified four distinct clusters of countries based on their well-being metrics. One notable cluster contained countries with high GDP and high life satisfaction, while another cluster included nations with lower GDP and mediocre life satisfaction, hinting at significant variations in social support and governance.

## 4. Implications and Suggestions Based on Findings
The insights derived from the analysis carry substantial implications for policymakers, researchers, and NGOs:

- **Focus on Economic and Non-Economic Factors**: While enhancing economic conditions is crucial, attention should also be directed toward improving social support systems, political stability, and transparent governance to uplift well-being, especially in nations identified as outliers.

- **Tailored Interventions for Clusters**: The country clusters can guide targeted interventions. For example, nations in the lower satisfaction clusters may benefit from programs aimed at increasing social support and reducing perceptions of corruption, alongside economic improvements.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Data Update**: This analysis underscores the importance of continuous data gathering and monitoring to adapt policies based on real-time feedback on well-being indicators. 

Overall, this comprehensive analysis serves as a foundational understanding for addressing complex social issues pertaining to national well-being and guiding future policy-making efforts.
